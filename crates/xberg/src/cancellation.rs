//! Cancellation token for extraction operations.
//!
//! Provides a lightweight, FFI-friendly cancellation primitive based on
//! `Arc<AtomicBool>`. The token can be cloned and shared across threads;
//! any holder can request cancellation and all other holders will observe
//! the request on their next check.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - `Arc<AtomicBool>` is used rather than `tokio_util::CancellationToken` so
//!   the type has no Tokio dependency at the type level and is usable from both
//!   sync and async contexts.
//! - `Ordering::Relaxed` is sufficient: we only need eventual visibility, not
//!   happens-before ordering relative to other memory accesses.
//! - The token wraps an `Arc<AtomicBool>` and can be stored in
//!   `ExtractionConfig` without layout surprises.
//!
//! # Rust callers
//!
//! Rust callers may place one clone in `ExtractionConfig::cancel_token` and
//! retain another clone in the application layer. Calling [`CancellationToken::cancel`]
//! requests that extraction stop when the active pipeline reaches its next
//! cancellation checkpoint. Cancellation is cooperative rather than immediate,
//! so latency depends on the extractor and operation currently in progress.
//!
//! # FFI and bindings
//!
//! No binding exposes cancellation today. `crates/xberg-ffi` emits no
//! cancellation handle and no `xberg_cancel*` symbol, and neither do the
//! Python, Node, JNI, PHP or WASM crates. Both this type and the
//! `ExtractionConfig::cancel_token` field carry `#[cfg_attr(alef, alef(skip))]`,
//! so codegen can never emit one — any binding surface would have to be
//! hand-written and hand-maintained.
//!
//! Xberg also uses the same token internally for extraction timeouts and the
//! REST async-job cancellation path (`DELETE /jobs/{job_id}`).
